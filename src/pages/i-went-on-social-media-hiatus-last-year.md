title: I went on a social media hiatus last year (2019)
date: '2020-01-14'
spoiler: It's been a year since my last post. There were lots of things going on last year, new opportunities, some challenges and a few setbacks, so I partially decided on a semi social media hiatus. I paused (correction, i stopped) replying to direct messages and group chats from social media and emails. I still post to Facebook and Twitter, but were very minimal. It seems like detoxing myself from social media helps.

It's been a year since my last post. There were lots of things going on last year, new opportunities, some challenges, and a few setbacks, so I partially decided on a semi-social media hiatus. I paused (correction, I stopped) replying to direct messages and group chats from social media and emails. I still post to Facebook and Twitter, but were very minimal. It seems like detoxing myself from social media helps.

Over the year, here are my self recollections and learnings

---

## Social media is stressful
Social Media, especially Facebook, is just honestly extremely stressful and depressing, especially with all the negative stuff you see every day from random posts from anybody or even those posts from your friends. I feel like distancing yourself from Facebook is a breather.

## Being a Soloist is not good
All along I thought I am a good team player, but most of the time I noticed that when I do a task or a project, it only counts if I do it myself. Resulting in sometimes, I felt ashame asking for help. Then I always compare achievements with others, like how come they do it easily and quickly, while I struggled so hard thinking that only if I'm intelligent enough, this shouldn't be hard. I noticed it because most of the time, I isolate myself, thinking I could do everything on my own - which is not good. I'm working on killing this bad attitude.

## Not everything needs to be perfect
Previously, I always believe that things must always be perfect. Like cakes should be fully baked, and not half baked. Well, I was wrong. Not everything needs to be perfect. Not everything needs to be planned so much. Sometimes (not every time ha) you just have to gonna jump in and figure it out along the way. Half ass is better than no ass. Better not to let perfectionism hold you back. The first version definitely is never gonna be as good as the 5th or 10th version. Just get it over the door and you can course-correct it as you go along.

## There's no shame in failures or setbacks
Normally, when things don't go our way, it quite depressing. We feel crushingly disappointed if we fail short. Most of the time, I felt ashamed of myself when things don't go as planned or if there's a delay in projects or unforeseen bugs, etc. And I'm fond of blaming myself for it. And I felt ashamed of it. But actually, we should not be ashamed. we did tried. The only time to be ashamed is when we don't try or we procrastinate down to the last minute and it didn't reflect our best effort - then shame is called for.

## Don't over personalized criticism
It wounds and crushes our soul. And it feels horrible when receiving criticism, especially when you worked so hard for it. But, I realized that I should not take it negatively. I should take it to challenge myself. Don't over personalized criticism. Also, when receiving praise, I just say thanks. But I realized, it is also better to say something like "Thanks, but what's one thing that I could have done to make it even better?" Maybe we could get some tips from the one giving us feedback.

## Celebrate small successes
I noticed that mini celebration after certain milestones or end of projects has an impact, at last to me, personally. It feels like a reward to yourself, for reaching such a stage in a project or for closing a feature, etc. Step back at the end of a project or feature delivery and say "I'm really happy that I did these X things" or maybe say something like "Good job for trying" regardless of the outcome. Don't just celebrate the wins, celebrate also when you did your best shot regardless if successful or not.

So yeah, these are the main learning I had after taking a break from social media. Remember to take care of yourself, mentally especially. Reward your self from time to time. And most importantly, don't be too hard on yourself. See ya!
