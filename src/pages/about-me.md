Not.Expert is the ugliest tech/programming blog ever created. Hahaha!

Im using this to log my personal learnings, attempts, experiments with various technologies that fascinates me.

If you find my articles helpful or awfully ugly or if you just want to say 'Hi!' , message me at Twitter [@xtrycatchblockx](https://twitter.com/xtrycatchblockx)
